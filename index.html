    <p><b><h2>Introduction</h2></b></p>
    The negative physical and mental effects of alcohol are common knowledge amongst many. Despite this, alcohol seems to affect many people, especially younger adults. After researching the effects of alcohol on the brain, we divided our study into four sections:
    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
      <li>Why Alcohol and what leads to Alcohol Dependency?</li>
      <li>The Short Term Effects of Alcohol</li>
      <li>Chronic Ethanol Use and the Impact on Brain Functions</li>
      <li>Alcohol and Mental Health</li>
      </ul>
By elaborating on the neurological effects of alcohol, we hope to promote awareness on alcohol’s consequential effects.

  <p><h2>Why do People Drink Alcohol?<h2><p></section>
  <section>
    In order to understand why people turn to alcohol, it is important to address what alcohol is. Alcohol is a central nervous depressant that can affect the brain by releasing neurotransmitters, chemical messengers used by the nervous system to communicate signals between neurons. Dopamine is one of the many neurotransmitters that evokes positive emotions, increasing feelings of pleasure and wellbeing while reducing feelings of pain and lonliness. Drinking alcohol increases neurotransmitter release, such as dopamine, and causes the drinker to become more social and outgoing. As a result, alcohol dependence is formed. Alcohol dependence, also known as alcoholism, is a chronic disease seen in people with the inability to control drinking due to an emotional or physical dependence on alcohol.

<p><h2>Different Parts of the Brain that are Affected by Alcohol<h2><p>

  <ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li><h3>Hippocampus</h3></li>
    </ul>

    Located deep inside of the temporal lobe, the hippocampus plays a major role in <b>learning, comprehension, and memory.</b> The hippocampus is temporarily affected upon immediate alcohol consumption, resulting in short-term memory loss and blackouts. The hippocampus is very vulnerable to chronic alcohol consumption, and studies have shown that drinking reduces the size of the hippocampus. Not only does this <b>impair memory</b> and cause <b>mood swings</b>, but according to a medical newsletter written by Danielle Dresden, Alzheimer’s disease, depression, and stress are few of the many negative health problems linked to a smaller-sized hippocampus. </section>

  <ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li><h3>Cerebellum</h3></li>
    </ul>
    <img height="250" src="https://cdn.flintrehab.com/uploads/2020/11/cerebellum-damage.png"/>
    </section>
    <section>The cerebellum, located in the back of the brain below the temporal and occipital lobes, controls <b>basic movement and coordination</b>. Shortly after alcohol consumption, the drinker may experience cerebellar dysfunction which is when walking or staying balanced becomes difficult. Since drinking alcohol disrupts neurotransmission, communication between the muscles and nerves slow down. Additionally, excessive drinking over a long period of time can lead to the loss of cognitive skills since the cerebellum is linked to the nervous system.</section>

<section>
  <ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li><h3>Cerebral Cortex</h3></li>
    </ul>
    <img height="250" src="https://neuroscientificallychallenged.com/files/images/cerebral-cortex.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:491x377/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1"/>
    <section>The cerebral cortex is associated with <b>sight, smell, touch, and hearing</b>. As a result, drinking alcohol can increase the threshold for pain and dull the senses. Other functions of the cerebral cortex include <b>thought and reasoning</b>. An intoxicated person may behave abnormally and make rash decisions shortly upon alcohol consumption as drinking depresses inhibition. Chronic alcohol consumption can lead to neurodegeneration, the loss of function of neurons, permanently affecting one’s thought and reasoning.

  <ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li><h3>Hypothalamus</h3></li>
    </ul>
    <img height="250" src="https://cdn.flintrehab.com/uploads/2020/03/hypothalamus-damage.png"/>
    <section>The hypothalamus is the central link between the endocrine system and central nervous system and controls <b>body temperature, hunger, and thirst</b>. Shortly after alcohol consumption, the hypothalamus is no longer capable of keeping these functions in balance, especially in developing brains. An intoxicated person may feel the urge to urinate more often or become hungrier and thirstier. Simultaneously, their body temperature and heart rate may decrease. Chronic alcohol consumption can lead to temperature dysregulation and decreased sexual performance. Additionally, chronic alcohol consumption can lead to a smaller hypothalamus.</section>

  <ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li><h3>Central Nervous System</h3></li>
    </ul>

    <section>The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord. It controls <b>voluntary and involuntary movement</b>, such as walking or blinking, <b>thoughts and emotions</b>, and <b>communicates information between the body and brain</b>. Since alcohol is a central nervous depressant, alcohol consumption delays communication between essential nerves. The effects of alcohol on the central nervous system are too broad to list. Since the central nervous system is responsible for many functions, alcohol consumption can lead to many problems, such as the ones mentioned previously.</section>

  <p><b><h2>Mental Health of Alcohol</h2></b></p>
</section>
<section>

  <ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>Continuous alcohol consumption interferes with the endocrine system by disrupting communication between the nervous and endocrine system leading to physiological and behavioral consequences.</li>
    <li>Dopamine deficiency can lead to anxiety or depression</li>
    <li>Addiction</li>
    
  </ul>
